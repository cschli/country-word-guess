# Word-Guess-Game

After going into the page, begin by guessing a letter based on the initial word "_ _ _ _" that you will be guessing.

If you try to input a guess other than the 26 letters of the alphabet, or their capitalized counterparts, you will be
prompted with a warning at the bottom of the container to guess the correct input.

If you try to guess a letter that has already been guessed, you will be prompted with a warning at the bottom of the container.

Every time you guess an incorrect letter, the number of guesses remaining will drop from 5. Once it reaches zero, the game
ends in your loss, and the game starts over. 

If you guess all the letters of the word, you win and the game starts over.

The win/loss counters are tracked in the container and displayed to the player.
